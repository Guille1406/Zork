The angry people begun to follow “the marfil crown”, that venerate the died king and the hate to Pevensies, they was against of the actual crown. One hour ago, you was walking on the gardens when suddenly hear a noise on the bushes, you hide and listen that one men said: “The day is approaching, soon we will purified our lands and get honor to my father, I can’t accept one more day the fact of my nephew is a Pevensies. Live long to the marfil crown.” And you saw the messenger running to the castle, but you cut not saw the face of the other man, just a scar that only the twins have.
